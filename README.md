## Repository organisation

Each folder contains codes to run simulations and generate figures.

Folder "membrane_potential" for panel B from figures 4, 8 and 10

Folder "correlation" for panel D (top) from figuress 4, 8 and 10

Folder "step_input" for panel E from figures 4, 8 and 10

Folder "learning" for figures 7 and 9

## Coding language and compilers

Codes were originally written to run on Intel Fortran compiler. For reproducibility the codes posted here were rewritten to run with GNU Fortran (gfortran; free). Plots are made with gnuplot. To run the code from this repository you need both GNU Fortran (gfortran) and Gnuplot installed on a linux machine.

Figures in the original article were made with gnuplot and Inkscape.
