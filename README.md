# Codes used for article: Attentional switch in sensory circuits via complementary inhibitory receptive field profiles

Everton J. Agnes, Andrea I. Luppi, and Tim P. Vogels

Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK

Codes are related to bioRxiv preprint version 1 -> https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/729988v1

## Repository organisation

Each folder contains codes to run simulations and generate figures:

Folder "figs2_3_4_panel_B" for panel B from figs 2, 3 and 4

Folder "figs2_3_4_panel_D" for panel D (top) from figs 2, 3 and 4

## Coding language and compilers

Codes were originally written to run on Intel Fortran compiler. For reproducibility the codes posted here were rewritten to run with GNU Fortran (gfortran; free). Plots are made with gnuplot. Figures in the original article were made with gnuplot and Inkscape.
