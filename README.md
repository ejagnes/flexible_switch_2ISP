## Repository organisation

Each folder contains codes to run simulations and generate figures:

Folder "figs2_3_4_panel_B" for panel B from figs 2,3 and 4

## Coding language and compilers

Codes originally written to run on intel Fortran compiler and rewritten to run with GNU Fortran (gfortran; free). Plots are made with gnuplot. Figures in the original article were made with Inkscape (https://inkscape.org/).
