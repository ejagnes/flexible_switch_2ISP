## Repository organisation

Each folder contains codes to run simulations and generate figures:

Folder "figs2_3_4_panel_B" for panel B from figs 2, 3 and 4

Folder "figs2_3_4_panel_D" for panel D (top) from figs 2, 3 and 4

Folder "figs2_3_4_panel_E" for panel E from figs 2, 3 and 4

Folder "fig6_panelsB_D_F" for panels B, D and F from fig 6

Foler "fig8" for all panels from fig 8

## Coding language and compilers

Codes were originally written to run on intel Fortran compiler. For reproducibility some codes were rewritten to run with GNU Fortran (gfortran; free) and posted here. Plots are made with gnuplot. Figures in the original article were made with gnuplot and Inkscape.
